## How to Create a New React App (With Create-React-App)

1. Open a terminal session to the directory you would like your project to be stored.

```sh
C:\Users\Alex\Documents>
```

2. Use NPX to create a new react app using create-react-app in that directory with the name of the project.

```sh
C:\Users\Alex\Documents>npx create-react-app project-name
```

You don't need to worry about Webpack or Babel if you use create-react-app :)
